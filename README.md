# graph_similarity
I am doing a small project with Prof Eric Shaffer about graph similarity.

HITS algorithm (first version):
By using HITS algorithm, both authority score and hub scores will be presented individually as two numpy array. Only the structure will be considered, which means if two graphs share the same frame (the positional relations of the vertices and edges) but not the indices, it will still be counted as similarity.
